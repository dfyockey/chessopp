IMPORTANT NOTE:
{
  To build Chess Opponent from code checked out or cloned from a version
  control system such as Subversion or Git, you must first execute the
  command

	autoreconf --install

  before continuing with the usual installation procedure. This need be
  done only once after checkout; the checked out code may be then be
  configured and/or made repeatedly as needed without reexecuting the
  autoreconf command.
}

Otherwise, the usual procedure should apply. After you have unpacked
the sources (or checked-out/cloned and autoreconf'ed them), type (in
the sources top-level directory)

	./configure
	make

You may also pass several other options such as compiler options
to configure, just type ./configure --help for advice. In particular,
you may experiment with compiler optimization flags, which are added
easily as (assuming you have a bourne-type shell)

CFLAGS="-O3 -ffast-math" ./configure

The build should work with gcc. It should also work with other
compilers.

Test chessopp by typing

	cd src
	./chessopp on GNU/Linux / Unix / Mac OS X
	easy
	new
	post
	depth 8
	go
	quit

You should see an 8-ply search. Most machines these
days should finish it within a few seconds. If not,
Control-C out, and do 

	depth 6
	go
	quit

instead.

If you got this far, congratulations.

If you want to install the software in some global directory,
by default /usr/local, become root and type

	make install

If you want to install the sources in some other directory
than /usr/local, replace the first line by

	./configure --prefix=/my/favourite/dir 

You can build an opening book which may enhance the value
of chessopp quite a lot. In order to do so, get the file
book_1.02.pgn (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/chess/book_1.02.pgn.gz)
and type the following.

	./chessopp
	book add book_1.02.pgn
	quit

This may take some minutes, depending on the speed of your
machines. The book is quite large (180,000 master games).
If you want a smaller book or you do not want to wait, do the
following instead:

	head -30000 book_1.02.pgn > smallbook.pgn
	./chessopp
	book add smallbook.pgn
	quit

This will make a much smaller book.

In order to use the book, edit chessopp.ini and set the value of
'Book' or 'OwnBook' to true.

You can run the program in UCI mode, which makes it externally behave as 
a UCI engine. This is not intended for interactive usage, but for backend 
engine of a UCI-enabled chess graphical interface. Type the following:

	./chessopp -u
